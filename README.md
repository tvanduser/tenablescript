# tenablescript
automatically assigns tenable agents to their respective groups so they can be scanned 

How it works 
  Looks at the naming convention of the device that was unnassigned to be scanned and then based on the naming convention adds to the respective group to be scanned 2x a day.

  Runs 2x a day on windows task scheduler in order to collect and assign all of the new laptops/desktops that roll out each and every day
